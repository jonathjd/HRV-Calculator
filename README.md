## Description
Do you want to maximize your training? Whether you're a recreational athlete or olympic champion, it's essential that we all make informed decisions regarding our health and perfromance each and every day. This model will help you do just that. Heart rate variability (HRV) is the variability that occurs between each heart beat throughout the day. A ***high*** HRV indicates that you're rested and it's time to train hard! :runner: Conversely, a ***low*** HRV indicates that maybe you aren't rested, and you should take it easy for the day :sleeping:

## Model use ***(Coming soon!)***
Head on over to my personal [website](https://share.streamlit.io/jonathjd/webapp/main/main.py) where you can enter your current resting heart rate, and the model will give you a prediction on whether you should go hard or kick your feet up :wink:

### Data collection
Aggregated data that was collected from WHOOP fitness band and analyzed trends and correlative variables that influenced fat loss and increase body composition over a 12-week training cycle. After exploratory data analysis, a predictive model was generated using linear regression to attempt to predict heart rate variability from resting heart rate values.
